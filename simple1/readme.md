# 1dof robot

Notes :
- To open already trained robot, download all files and run 1dof_1.py
- To do robot training for another task, download-edit-run 1dof_1 neural-genetic training.py

The robot in 1dof_1.py was trained to be able to move along x axis positively, that means this robot can't move backward. That's because this thing just trained with positive target position. You can train it with training file and modify the training process.
